# Buttery

A React library for building animations and interactions.

If you're curious, check out the **EXTREMELY** work in progress [documentation](https://paulshen.github.io/react-prototyper/).

### What is this?

Buttery provides a powerful `<Layer>` component for creating animated and interactive applications.

If you love React and design prototyping, take a look! Think of this as a hybrid of [Animated](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html), [Origami](http://origami.design/), [Framer](https://github.com/koenbok/Framer), and [react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion).
